Xaitsnue Community Dictionary Project
========

This website houses a dictionary of the Xaitsnue language created by members of the Xaitsnue community and [the UC Berkeley Department of Linguistics](https://lx.berkeley.edu/). It is based on [this template](https://eddersko.github.io/web-template/) by [@eddersko](https://github.com/eddersko).
